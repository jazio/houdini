# Houdini, the Future of CSS

## Intro

Horizons track, because it is both tangential to Drupal, and also is only now on the horizon even for general usage. The presentation is a glimpse of the future, not something to use in production today.

Bad title, should be the future of CSS **specs**! CSS remains as easy as ever, with simple declarative syntax for powerful features.

## What will it bring to webdev?

Houdini allows you to modify the browser rendering engine!

 - Why? You've always wanted this, it just wasn't available.
 - Normalize cross-browser differences
 - Polyfill bleeding edge features so that people can use them today.
 - Prototype something brand new?

These are things JS can do in the span of days or weeks. Meanwhile we wait for ages to let browsers adopt CSS specs, _then_ we wait again for the old browsers to fall into disuse before it's "safe" to use.

CSS puts dev cycle on the timeline of JS, allowing prototyping and **native** polyfilling. We can normalize browsers and safely implement new or custom CSS properties.
